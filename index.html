            Help create an open data format for Congressional contact forms
          </h1>

          <h2>Why</h2>
          <p>As of now the only way to send electronic messages to members of Congress is by either using an expensive proprietary third party vendor or directly visiting each legislator's contact form. Those contact forms are cumbersome and difficult to use. In order to be able to create simpler tools for contacting legislators, we've created an open data format that describes their contact forms.</p>

          <p>This dataset will be a foundation that'll allow open government and advocacy organizations to create tools to allow users to email Congress.</p>

          <h2>Who</h2>
          <p>
            This dataset will be used by the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> for <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/">OpenCongress.org</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/">the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, and by <a href="https://taskforce.is">Taskforce.is</a> to help constituents advocate for better technology laws. All of the data is being placed into the <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress#public-domain">public domain</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Status</h2>
          <div class="current-status">
            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> &nbsp;Created a standardized YAML data format for describing legislator contact forms.</p>
            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> &nbsp;Created a bookmarklet to make it easy to generate YAML files</p>

          <h2>Help us</h2>
          <p>There are 439 individual contact forms. We've made tools to make the process simple, but we need help from volunteers to make this happen.</p>

          <h2>Contributing</h2>
          <p><strong>It's easy!</strong> You need only basic programming proficiency to be able to help us generate the YAML files that make up the contact-congress dataset.</p>
          <p>Here's how to get involved:</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="container-fluid main instructions">

          <div class="update">
            <h3>We're almost there: help us get to 100% </h3>
            <p>We though this'd take weeks, but in about 16 hours we've gotten 90% of the way there - a big big thanks to all those who've helped! It's been all kinds of awesome. This last 10% is going to be the hardest though, <strong>read on for how you can help get us there.</strong></p>
            <p>In the list at the bottom of this page, there are a lot of representatives who have less than 100% completion rate. That means that since the last update to their YAML file, not all the tests performed in the test-tool have succeeded.</p>
            <p>Ideally we want all of them to be at 100%. Here's how to get there:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Find a rep with &lt;100% completion rate, check the github issues to make sure no one's been working on it very recently (many have older comments), and comment to let the world know you're on the case. You can reopen the issue if it's closed.</li>
              <li>For some of the reps, the failures were because of bugs with congress-form-test that have now been fixed. Try populating and testing again a few times, and if they work consistently, simply touch the YAML file (add whitespace at the end of a line) to reset the log of tests, push the changes, and then run tests again so the success rate is 100%. Easy :).</li>
              <li>Some are failing because the address/zip codes that the test tool pulls in are wrong. To fix that:
                <ul>
                  <li>First you'll need a valid address/zip+4 combination. Try the zip codes from the district offices listed at the bottom of rep's pages. They usually won't have a +4 included, so use <a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action?mode=0&refresh=true" target="_blank">USPS's search tool</A> to find those. </li>
                  <li>Once you have a valid address, go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sinak/congress-zip-plus-four/">congress-zip-plus-four repo</a>. You'll want to update the addresses with ones that work in both the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sinak/congress-zip-plus-four/blob/master/8-%20output-final-with-senate.csv">8- output-final-with-senate.csv</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sinak/congress-zip-plus-four/blob/master/legislators.json">legislators.json</a> files. Submit a pull request and we'll merge.</li>
                  <li>Once that's done, test the legislators and make sure they pass. Then touch their YAML files  (add whitespace at the end of a line) to reset the stats, push the changes, and then runn tests again and you're done.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>In other cases, it'll be problem with the YAML files. In that case, troubleshoot them. Check out the troubleshooting tips on the left hand side below the Step 3 video on this page.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Badges can take up to a few minutes to update, so if it doesn't happen immediately but the test tool shows 100% passing, trust that they will eventually :).</p>
              <p>As always we'll be on IRC (#opencongress on freenode, <a href="http://theunitedstates.io/contact-congress/irc.html" target="_blank">web interface</a>) if you have problems or questions.</p>
              <p>Again, a big big thanks from the teams at EFF and Sunlight Foundation who've been working on this!</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Generate a YAML file.</h3>
          <div class="row step">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <div class="video-container">

                <p style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Something go wrong?</strong> Here are common issues:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The "state" field looks like a dropdown but doesn't actually have any options, or the zip code field is pre-filled</strong><br>
                    In some cases, a member's form will automatically copy over a field (like the zip code) from the first page of the form to the second, or have a default value (like in the state dropdown). The latter happens at 6:25 in the video above. If that happens, you should mark those inputs  as "leave as default," since a parser wouldn't need to make a change to that field in order to submit it.</li>
                  <li><strong>The bookmarklet goes blank after I submit the first form.</strong><br>
                    This happens because the contact form switched from HTTP to HTTPS after you submitted the first page. For security reasons browsers will block the bookmarklet from working. In Chrome, there's a console error that reads:<br> <code> Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://crawford.house.gov" from accessing a frame with origin "https://crawford.house.gov". Protocols must match.</code> <br>The only solution is to use the bookmarklet separately on the first page and the second page of the contact form, and then merge the two resulting YAML files together manually. If you're just getting started, skip this file and come back to it once you've had some practice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Errors that can be seen in the developer javascript console of the bookmarklet:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'selector' of undefined</strong><br>
                    This error most often happens when the submit button was not automagically detected.  Setting the submit button field in the bookmarklet to '[submit button]' should allow you to progress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'repr' of undefined</strong><br>
                    This is a known bug that has not been resolved yet.  Please reference the issue you are working on <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress/issues/681">here</a> and move on to another issue.</li>
                  <li><strong>Uncaught JS-YAML: unacceptabe kind of an object to dump [object Undefined]</strong><br>
                    This is also a known bug that has not yet been resolved.  Please reference the issue you are working on <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress/issues/621">here</a> and move on to another issue.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p><em>We recommend watching the video first, as it'll make this part much simpler to understand.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Make sure you completed  #5 above and claimed a rep's Github issue before starting work on generating YAML.</strong></p>
              <p>1 - Find the Rep's contact page using a Google search.</p>
              <p>2 - Click the bookmarklet (you'll need to allow popups). Select the correct form from the list shown in the popup. The bookmarklet will attempt to automatically match the inputs to our predefined YAML variables, but it'll likely miss a few. Make sure that any required fields are marked as such in the popup. Required fields are ones that need to be changed in order for the form to submit correctly.</p>
              <p>3 - Once you're done, click "Next" in the popup. The bookmarklet will fill the form with its default values automatically. Now press the submit button at the end of member of Congress's form.</p>
              <p>4 - If there's a second page to the form, click the "Next Form" button and repeat the process above  (otherwise you can skip to the next step). Note that depending on the type of form, you might be asked for a "Selector to find before proceeding." This is so that any parsers can tell when the second part of the form has loaded. You can usually use the form's selectors from the dropdown above, but in rare cases you may need to change later down the road. When you're done, click the 'Next' button in the bookmarklet again, and then submit the form on the member of Congress's site.</p>
              <p>5 - You'll now likely be onto the Congress member's "success" page. If something's gone wrong, you'll have to start again. Otherwise, click the "Finished" button in the bookmarklet. Select some text from the legislator's success page that will identify the request as having worked, and paste it into the success message box on the popup. Avoid copying across html tags by find a part of the success page that is plain text.</p>
              <p>6 - Click the "Done! Let's send it to Github!" button, then click the "new file on Github" link and copy the resulting YAML text into the new file. In your commit mesage, include something like "First pass at #123," where 123 is the Github issue associated with the congress member you're working on.</p>
              <p>7 - Now submit your change as a pull request, and wait for it to be accepted. We'll try to accept Github issues as quickly as soon as we see them.</p>

                  <li><strong>Sometimes you're testing a YAML file and everything seems to be right, but the the test tool records a "failure."</strong> <br>
                    When this happens go to the contact form page and manually fill in everything exactly as it appears in the screenshot. Then click submit. If it submits correctly then either a) the success criteria is wrong, or b) the form is being loaded via javascript and you need to add an extra "find" action to your YAML file to search for a DOM element that only exists on the success page. For example this happened in <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress/issues/198" target="_blank">#198</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress/commit/76f4f8bc488ed56918695ef8cccb80d227adf2af">this commit</a> fixed the issue.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>1 - Find the Congress member's name in the list below and click the "tools" link.</p>
              <p>2 - Check the "updated at" time to make sure that the latest version of your YAML file has been uploaded. The times are updated every minute.</p>
              <p>3 - Click to populate the form with default values, then click to submit it to your representative. You'll get a success or error message after a few seconds.</p>
              <p>4 - If there's an error, look in the "Recent Fill Attempts" section and click on the top entry. You'll see a screenshot and an error message.</p>
              <p>5 - Based on the legislator's contact form, the YAML file you've generated, and the error message, try and figure out what's causing the issue. <a href="https://github.com/sinak/congress-zip-plus-four/blob/master/8-%20output-final-with-senate.csv">This csv of valid addresses for each representative</a> may help. Make changes to your YAML file, resubmit them, and wait for the status message to update. If you continue to have problems, add a note to your Github issue and ping us on IRC.</p>
              <p>6 - Once the YAML file is submitting properly, you can close your representative's Github issue!<br><span class="warning">For the first few, ping us in IRC and we'll close for you. After that we'll make you a collaborator on the rep.</span></p>

          <h5>After you have successfully completed two pull-requests, ask in IRC and someone will give you commit access.</h5>

          <!-- <h3>2. Make some YAML Files!</h3>
          <p>First click on the bookmarklet and select a legislator to work on from the dropdown that appears at the top of the current page. An 'x' next to their name means that person hasn't been done yet, and a '!' means their form is known to be broken.</p>
          <p><img src="images/select-legislator.png" alt="select a legislator screenshot"></p>
          <p>You'll be redirected to that rep's site. If you don't land on their contact form or a 'zipcode authentication' page (seen below) you'll have to click around til you're there. Then click the bookmarklet again.</p>
          <p>A popup window will appear (<a href="#popups">see below</a> for info on allowing popups from the house and senate) prompting you to select a form to work with. Choose the one that looks like it pertains to the form you need to solve, in this case one with the class 'zipform.'</p>
          <p><img src="images/zip-auth.png" alt="zip auth screenshot"></p>
          <p>Once a form is selected you'll see a list of all of the form elements found within it, and a dropdown from which you can select the values that go into each field. They may already be selected by default. Make sure that the values are correct, and that the checkbox is ticked for each required field (above we probably need to mark the zip4 as a required field so it works the same for everyone in one step), and be sure that the submit button is marked with [submit button].</p>
          <p>Click 'Next' on the popup. The form will be filled in automatically appropriate values, and the popup text will change. It instructs us to submit the form and then choose whether to add another form or finish up. Since we've only proven our zip code, we need to add another form.</p>
          <p><img src="images/step-saved.png" alt="step saved screenshot"></p>
          <p><strong>Don't forget to submit the form manually before clicking 'next form'!</strong></p>
          <p>Again you're presented with a choice of form to work with. You may have to try a couple before you see the types of fields you're expecting, but typically there will be an ID in the selector of the one that you want, and often the words custom_form in the name. In this case, it's pretty awful: <code>#ctl00_ctl12_ctl00_Text form</code>.</p>
          <p>Once the form is loaded, you can confirm that you have the one you want by hovering over the various dropdowns--you should see each field highlight as you move your mouse over the popup.</p>
          <p>Fill out the form in the popup again (and again it's likely to be mostly filled out for you). <strong>Take note, though,</strong> that at the very top of the form is a text field with a selector to find before proceeding. Make sure that this is filled out with a selector that exists on the page.</p>
          <p><img src="images/fill-out-form.png" alt="fill out form screenshot"></p>
          <p>When you're done, click 'next' again, and submit the contact form once it's filled out. <strong>If filled out correctly, it will send an actual message to the legislator, so try not to do this over and over again!</strong></p>
          <p><img src="images/fill-out-form-2.png" alt="fill out form 2 screenshot"></p>
          <p>After you submit the form, click 'finished' on the popup (or next form if there are more to be filled out). Select some text from the legislator's success page that will identify the request as having worked, and paste it into the success message box on the popup. Avoid copying across html tags, if possible.</p>
          <p><img src="images/success-message.png" alt="success message screenshot"></p>
          <p>Click the button at the bottom, and copy the resulting YAML text into a new file on github by clicking the link at the top of the popup.</p>
          <p><img src="images/submit.png" alt="submit screenshot"></p>
          <p>Submit your pull request and you're done!</p> -->
